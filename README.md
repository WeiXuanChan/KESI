# KESI
(Kernel Emotion Supported Intelligence)

### Overall Objective
This project attempt to simulate human-level emotion and motivation via building blocks in an closed form operating system (O.S) as the foundation of an artificial general intelligence given the required sensors, output, and computational power.

####Current Objectives (version: FOIN)
Using current state (determined by past memory and states, emotion module) as a determination for resource (processing power) allocation.

#####Modules
######Emotion: Resource (CPU) allocation module
Hapiness (Sadness):High Echo (for +-)

Adrenaline (Serenity): High Ection (for +), High Experience (for +)

Curiousity (Boredom): High Experience (for +), High Expectant (for +)
######Expectant: Prediction module of following input outcome (paired with output) (access to memory)
Multiple ideas input?
######Echo: Memory allocation of storing past state and linking emotion, expectant, and ection. (Ideas)
ideas linkage and relationship assignment A= (g)B, (h)C etc. Multiple ideas input?
######Ection: Output module based on prediction (Expectant) (contains output driver)
Favours + Happiness result
######Experience: Input driver to sensible data, (include input emotion (current state))
